Analysis and Detection of Cataract


# What we wanted to make? 

Cataract Detection Technique by CNN model using Retina image and Recommend doctors based on Locality. 
We wanted to use both retinal as well as normal eye image for cataract detection. 

# What did we make? 

We made cataract detection using retinal images. We used Convolutional Neural Network with a pretrained image for the weights of the first few layers to speed things along. We got a good accuracy and now we need to integrate the frontend with backend with the model

# What we hope to make?

We hope to make an end to end model in the future and hopefully be able to train our model using normal eye images too.
